Please read this I am learning git and version control and this is very important. 

# Learning Git

Our todo:
- [X] Create a new file
- [X] Make first commit
- [X] Fix this typo


ToDo list is completed and I now know how to use git bash for all my version control needs. I deleted the project (on purpose) but all is well because you can just clone the repository onto the local drive once again to retrieve the lost project. This is great and very useful because it would not be a surprise if I deleted something that is actually very important while under the premise that it is unimportant at the time of deleting and then being consumed by regret.  

Commands I now know:
- git add
- git commit
- rename files via git mv old_file_name.ext new_file_name.ext
- git diff
- git status
- git push 
- git clone
- cd .. ; cd ../.. (and so on); cd - ; cd ~
